Got it — you're expecting Replit to apply your table schema automatically, but it's not adding the followers_count column. That usually means one of two things:


---

🔍 Why Replit Didn't Solve It

1. Your schema (pgTable) includes followers_count, but migrations are not being run or synced properly.


2. Or, your schema file doesn’t include the followers_count column yet — Replit is just creating tables from whatever schema it has, and this field is missing.




---

✅ Here's How You Can Fix It on Replit

Step 1: Manually Add followers_count in Schema

Go to your schema file — likely in:

/server/schema.ts

Make sure your users table looks like this:

export const users = pgTable('users', {
  id: serial('id').primaryKey(),
  username: varchar('username', { length: 255 }).notNull().unique(),
  // other fields...
  followers_count: integer('followers_count').default(0),
});

> If this line is missing, Replit can't add the column automatically.




---

Step 2: Force Schema Sync

If you’re using Drizzle ORM, Replit won’t auto-migrate unless you tell it to. Run this in the Replit shell (bottom tab in workspace):

npx drizzle-kit push

> This will push the new schema to the Neon/Postgres database connected to Replit.




---

Step 3: Verify Table

You can verify from Replit's Postgres (if using Neon):

Log into the Neon dashboard.

Go to the SQL Editor.

Run:


SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 1;

If followers_count appears, it's working.


---

🛠 If You Want a Temporary Fix (No CLI):

In your Replit server/index.ts, inside initializeDatabase(), add:

await db.execute(sql`ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS followers_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;`);

Then deploy or run the app once — it’ll silently fix the missing column.

After that, you can remove that line.

✅ Summary

Fix Type	Action

Code-based	Add followers_count to pgTable in schema.ts
Drizzle migration	Run npx drizzle-kit push in Replit shell
Temporary SQL	Add ALTER TABLE query inside initializeDatabase()
Verify	Use Neon SQL Editor or Replit DB logs
