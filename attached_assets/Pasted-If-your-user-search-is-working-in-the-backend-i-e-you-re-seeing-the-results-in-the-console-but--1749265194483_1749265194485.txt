If your user search is working in the backend (i.e., you're seeing the results in the console), but not displaying them on the screen, the issue is likely in your frontend code. Here's a checklist and solution path to help you fix it:

✅ Checklist to Fix "Not Showing Results on Screen" Issue

1. Check if you are updating the state with the results

Make sure you're using useState or similar to store and render the search results.



2. Ensure your rendering logic is correct

The part of your UI that displays the results should properly map over the data and display it.



3. Confirm that the UI is re-rendering

If you're setting state correctly but still not seeing results, ensure the component is actually re-rendering.



4. Check for conditional rendering issues

Make sure there’s no logic hiding the search results (e.g., if (!results) return null;).



5. Ensure CSS isn’t hiding the result

Sometimes display: none, visibility: hidden, or size issues might make it appear invisible.



6. Check error boundaries and logs

See if there are any JavaScript errors in the browser console that might stop rendering.

🛠 Sample Code Fix (React Example)

Here’s a simple working pattern to show how it should be:

import { useState } from "react";
import axios from "axios";

function UserSearch() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("");
  const [results, setResults] = useState([]);

  const handleSearch = async (e) => {
    setQuery(e.target.value);
    if (e.target.value.length > 1) {
      try {
        const res = await axios.get(/api/search?query=${e.target.value});
        console.log("Results from backend:", res.data); // ✅ Backend is responding
        setResults(res.data); // ✅ Update state to show results
      } catch (err) {
        console.error("Search error:", err);
      }
    } else {
      setResults([]); // Clear results if input is empty
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={query}
        onChange={handleSearch}
        placeholder="Search users"
      />
      <ul>
        {results.map((user) => (
          <li key={user.id}>{user.username}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
